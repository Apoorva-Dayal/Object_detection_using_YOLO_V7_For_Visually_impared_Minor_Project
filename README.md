# Object_detection_using_YOLO_V7_For_Visually_impared_Minor_Project
Me and my teammate PIYUSH are working on a minor project. Our project title is " Object Detection Using Yolo V7 for the Visually Impaired". In this project, our main work is to create an application that will speak out üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èthe detected Object along with its count . It has both live camera access and an image upload option for object detection.
